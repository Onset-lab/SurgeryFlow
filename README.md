The SurgeryFlow pipeline is a fully automated and reproducible tractography pipeline that extract requested white matter bundles.
SurgeryFlow takes raw DICOM directory (containing DWI, T1, and a reversed phase encoded b=0 if available) and the list of requested bundles.

SurgeryFlow is based on [TractoFlow](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116889) Pipeline.

- dwi brain extraction (FSL)
- N4 DWI (ANTs)
- crop DWI (Scilpy)
- upsample DWI (Scilpy)
- upsample B0 (Scilpy)
- extract SH fitted to DWI (Scilpy)

T1 processes
- denoise T1 (Scilpy)
- N4 T1 (ANTs)
- resample T1 (Scilpy)
- T1 brain extraction (ANTs)
- crop T1 (Scilpy)

- Lesion_On_Anat (Scilpy)

Metrics processes
- extract DTI shells (configurable in `nextflow.config`) (Scilpy)
- dti metrics (Scilpy)
- extract fODF shells (configurable in `nextflow.config`) (Scilpy)
